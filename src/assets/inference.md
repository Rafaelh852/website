# The Rules of Inference

A top down overview of Inference from a tabular perspective. 520 material

## Base

| Inference | Freq | bayesian | exp fam and GLM |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| paramter estimation |  |  |  |
| prediction |  |  |  |
| test of hypothesis |  |  |  |
| intervals |  |  |  |
| power |  |  |  |

## Advanced

The rules of inference begin with a distribution a frequency and  

parameter estimation 

prediction

test of hypothesis 

intervals 

power

good estimators

sufficiency

efficiency

MLE

optimal test of hypothesis

the tools rao blackwell

the distributions to know

- gamma
- chi
- normal
- t

known properties

- sample properties

Doing the math

- what to integrate what to pivot etc.
