# Unemployment in the U.S

Unemployment data in the U.S shows that roughly 8 years of progress has been lost in  the efforts to reduce unemployment rates since 2010. Many states faced similar levels of unemployment that they did in 2012. However, some states were more resilient than others the second time around. The resilience in unemployment is an important factor, not only in economic growth but in the well-being of the people that reside in it. 

The well-being of those in the economy that is impacted by unemployment is affected in more than just a monetary manner. It's been studied that the increase in unemployment has an impact on the suicide rates of people. As unemployment goes up, so do suicide rates. One measure that has been found to reduce this risk, is the resilience to unemployment that the government places to combat it. Meaning the more efforts, the government puts into decreasing the unemployment rate, the lower the suicide rates. So, looking at how resilient each state is to unemployment is an indicator to how well the government has managed to not only reduce unemployment but its ability to combat the issues that it brings. 

Collectively every state benefit from nearly 2 years resilience to the events that took place in 2020. That is, cumulatively, we did not lose 10 years worth of progress in reducing unemployment but instead only 8. Note that the measure of unemployment we have used is the number of unemployed divided by the number of available workers.

However, despite having similar levels of unemployment as mid-2011 to 2012, California benefits from having a lower unemployment rate than 2012. Meaning a year and a half worth of resilience to the events of 2020. Meaning the protections that local government of California has been for the most part, effective. This, in comparison to Texas who has been the lead in unemployment rates for the past 10 years has shown that very little protection exists from the local government.

There were no changes to the ranking of who received the highest levels of unemployment to the top 10 states. However, when we filtered based on the top 15, we began to see that the Spot for AL and NY had switched. When inspecting closely, NY had suffered the exact same levels of unemployment they did in 2020 as in 2010. This can be either attributed to the increase in population of NY over the past 10 years or the poor management of local government have protections in place.

When looking at the number of states who suffered an unemployment rate of over 800 only 5 states did in 2020 vs a little over 15 in 2010. Meaning fewer states were feeling similar effects that were happening in 2010. So, the magnitude for each state was lowered and thus the effects where more spread out that accumulated. This gives local government more of a chance in reducing these effects rather than in the hands of a few states. 
 
The Events that took place in 2020 undid 8 years worth economic progress. The resilience of the states to these effects are in the hands of not only the business owners but also local government. The more intervention, perhaps the more we are better off. However, that might not be what would be best for economy. We cannot hope to fix the crack in the wall with just duct tape. It is a much more complicated issue than what we can gather through data.
